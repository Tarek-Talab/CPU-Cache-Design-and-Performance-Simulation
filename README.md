# CPU-Cache-Design-and-Performance-Simulation
This project analyzes the CPU-Cache interaction, a core computer architecture component, based on William Stallings' theoretical frameworks. It provides a simulation environment to measure software efficiency at the hardware level, focusing on mapping techniques and performance optimization.

**Note:** The project simulation and technical presentation are prepared in Turkish, as this was developed as part of my Software Engineering coursework at the Faculty of Engineering.

## 🚀 Key Features (Öne Çıkan Özellikler)
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Implementation of William Stallings' Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) formula.
* **Mapping Analysis:** Comparative study of Direct, Fully Associative, and Set-Associative mapping techniques.
* **Performance Metrics:** Real-time calculation of Hit/Miss rates and their impact on CPU latency.
* **Simulation Environment:** Developed on **Xubuntu Linux** to analyze hardware-software interaction.
